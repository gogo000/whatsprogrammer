function X = reconstructCuboid(x,idx)

%{

This function implement the direct method of the following paper:

Direct Calibration by Fitting of Cuboids to a Single Image Using Differential Evolution
Luis Gerardo de la Fraga and Oliver Schütze


input
x is 7*2 vector of image cooridnates of the 7 corners (7 must be >= 6)
idx is a logical binary vector of length 7 to indicate which vector to be
use in the computation of estimation X

output
